# Reddit Saver
The idea is that *Reddit Saver* reads your reddit saved posts, fetches their
content links down, and figures if it could download it using wget or
youtube-dl (supposing it's installed on the machine). It then prompts the user
what links he wants to store, and downloads them.

## TODO
- Analysis of the links file
- Download of links content
