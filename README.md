# Reddit Saver
The idea is that *Reddit Saver* reads your reddit saved posts, fetches their
content links down, and figures if it could download them. 
It then prompts the user what links he wants to store, and downloads them.

## TODO
- Analysis of the links file [IN-PROGRESS]
- Download of links content [IN-PROGRESS]

### Notes
This was partially derived from [Sadiq Al-Khalili upvote downvote bot script](http://www.sadiqk.com/reddit-upvotedownvote-bot/). 
And requires mellorts' [reddit\_api](https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api).
Further usage notes will be added as the program gains any use. **lol**
