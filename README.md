# Reddit Saver
The idea is that *Reddit Saver* reads your reddit saved posts, fetches their
content links down, and figures if it could download it using wget or
youtube-dl (supposing it's installed on the machine). It then prompts the user
what links he wants to store, and downloads them.

## TODO
- Analysis of the links file
- Download of links content

### Notes
This was partially derived from [Sadiq Al-Khalili upvote downvote bot script](http://www.sadiqk.com/reddit-upvotedownvote-bot/). 
And requires mellorts' [reddit\_api](https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api).
Further usage notes will be added as the program gains any use. **lol**
